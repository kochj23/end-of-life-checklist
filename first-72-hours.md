## Hour 0-4: The Immediate Stuff

### If the person is still alive but incapacitated:
- [ ] Call 911 if not already done
- [ ] Go to the hospital — be present
- [ ] Ask the medical team: **"Is there a healthcare directive or DNR on file?"**
- [ ] Check the [Medical Directives](#where-are-the-medical-directives) section below for their wishes
- [ ] Contact the **Healthcare Power of Attorney** — this person makes medical decisions if the patient cannot
- [ ] Contact immediate family members (see Emergency Contacts below)

### If the person has died:
- [ ] If at home, call 911 — they will guide you on next steps
- [ ] If at a hospital or facility, staff will guide the immediate process
- [ ] **Do not rush.** You do not need to make funeral arrangements in the first hour. Breathe.
- [ ] Contact immediate family members (see Emergency Contacts below)
- [ ] Secure the home if you're not already there (lock doors, check on pets)

## Day 1-3: Getting Organized

### Death Certificate
- [ ] The funeral home typically handles ordering death certificates
- [ ] **Order at least 10-15 certified copies** — you will need more than you think
- [ ] Every bank, insurance company, government agency, and financial institution will want an original certified copy
- [ ] You can order more later, but it takes time — order plenty now

### Funeral / Memorial Planning
- [ ] Check the [Funeral Preferences section](the-checklist.md#funeral--memorial-preferences) for their wishes
- [ ] Choose a funeral home (or use the one they specified)
- [ ] Decide: burial or cremation (check their documented preference)
- [ ] Set a date for the service (usually 3-7 days out, but there's no rule)
- [ ] Ask someone to handle the obituary draft
- [ ] Designate someone to manage the guest logistics (food, flowers, venue)

### Financial — First Steps Only
- [ ] **Do NOT close any bank accounts yet** — you may need them for bills
- [ ] Identify which bills are on autopay and from which accounts (see [Financial section](the-checklist.md#financial))
- [ ] Make sure mortgage/rent gets paid this month
- [ ] Make sure utilities stay on
- [ ] Contact life insurance companies to start claims (they'll tell you what they need)
- [ ] If they were the primary earner, you may qualify for Social Security survivor benefits — don't rush this, but know it exists

### Digital — First Steps Only
- [ ] Access their phone if possible (see [Digital Life section](the-checklist.md#digital-life) for PIN/password info)
- [ ] Check their email for any time-sensitive items (bills, appointments, obligations)
- [ ] Do NOT delete any accounts yet — some may be needed for legal/financial processes
- [ ] If they have social media, consider posting a brief notice or having a friend do it
- [ ] Turn OFF any smart home automations that might be confusing (lights, routines, etc.)

## Where Are the Medical Directives?

*Fill this section in so someone can find these documents within minutes, not days.*

| Document | Location | Who Has a Copy |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Healthcare Power of Attorney | `_______________` | `_______________` |
| Living Will / Advance Directive | `_______________` | `_______________` |
| DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) Order | `_______________` | `_______________` |
| POLST / MOLST Form | `_______________` | `_______________` |
| Organ Donation Preference | `_______________` | `_______________` |

## Where Is the Password Manager?

*Almost everything in [the full checklist](the-checklist.md) points back to a password manager. Here's how to get into it.*

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| Password Manager Used | `_______________` (e.g., 1Password, Bitwarden, LastPass) |
| How to Access It | `_______________` |
| Emergency Kit / Recovery Info Location | `_______________` |
| Who Else Has Access | `_______________` |

> **Note for families:** A "password manager" is an app or service that stores all of someone's passwords in one secure place. You only need ONE master password or recovery kit to access everything inside it. The location of that master password or recovery kit is the single most important piece of information in this entire document.

## The Short Version

If you're overwhelmed and can only do five things today:

1. **Notify the inner circle** (the emergency contacts above)
2. **Secure the home and the pets**
3. **Find the will** (check the location listed in this document)
4. **Don't close or cancel anything yet** — just make sure this month's bills get paid
5. **Take care of yourself** — eat something, drink water, sleep when you can

Everything else can wait. You have more time than you think.
