# First 72 Hours

**If you're reading this, something has happened. This page tells you what to do and in what order. Read it top to bottom.**

---

## Hour 0-4: The Immediate Stuff

### If the person is still alive but incapacitated:
- [ ] Call 911 if not already done
- [ ] Go to the hospital — be present
- [ ] Ask the medical team: **"Is there a healthcare directive or DNR on file?"**
- [ ] Check the [Medical Directives](#where-are-the-medical-directives) section below for their wishes
- [ ] Contact the **Healthcare Power of Attorney** — this person makes medical decisions if the patient cannot
- [ ] Contact immediate family members (see Emergency Contacts below)

### If the person has died:
- [ ] If at home, call 911 — they will guide you on next steps
- [ ] If at a hospital or facility, staff will guide the immediate process
- [ ] **Do not rush.** You do not need to make funeral arrangements in the first hour. Breathe.
- [ ] Contact immediate family members (see Emergency Contacts below)
- [ ] Secure the home if you're not already there (lock doors, check on pets)

### Time-Sensitive Religious or Cultural Requirements

> **Some faiths require action within hours, not days.** Jewish and Muslim traditions typically require burial within 24 hours. Some traditions have specific body preparation requirements. If the person had religious or cultural preferences, check the [Religious & Cultural Requirements section](the-checklist.md#religious--cultural-requirements) in the full checklist NOW — before making any arrangements with a funeral home.

---

## Hour 4-24: The First Day

### People to Notify
- [ ] Employer / HR department — they may have life insurance, final pay, benefits info
- [ ] Close friends and extended family — **delegate this.** Ask one person to be the "phone tree" lead.
- [ ] Religious leader or officiant (if applicable)
- [ ] Attorney (if not already contacted)
- [ ] Insurance companies (life insurance — see [the full checklist](the-checklist.md#life-insurance))

### Things to Secure
- [ ] **The home** — make sure it's locked, mail is collected, and lights/heat stay on
- [ ] **Pets** — are they fed, walked, medicated? See the [Pets section](the-checklist.md#pets) for care details
- [ ] **Children** — if there are minor children, contact the designated guardian immediately. See [Children & Dependents](the-checklist.md#children--dependents) for school info, medications, routines.
- [ ] **Vehicles** — are any parked somewhere they shouldn't be? Move them home if needed
- [ ] **Perishables** — check the fridge. Throw out anything that will go bad this week.
- [ ] **Mail** — collect it. Start collecting it daily. Important bills, legal notices, and tax documents will keep arriving for months. See [Physical Mail](the-checklist.md#physical-mail) section.

### Documents to Locate
- [ ] **The Will** — see [Legal section](the-checklist.md#legal) for where it is
- [ ] **Power of Attorney** documents
- [ ] **Life insurance policies**
- [ ] **Birth certificate** and **Social Security card** (needed for death certificate process)

### Things You Do NOT Need to Do Today
- You do not need to close bank accounts today
- You do not need to cancel subscriptions today
- You do not need to figure out the estate today
- You do not need to plan the funeral today (you have days, not hours)
- You do not need to post on social media today
- **You are allowed to eat, sleep, and fall apart. Do those things.**

---

## Day 1-3: Getting Organized

### Death Certificate
- [ ] The funeral home typically handles ordering death certificates
- [ ] **Order at least 10-15 certified copies** — you will need more than you think
- [ ] Every bank, insurance company, government agency, and financial institution will want an original certified copy
- [ ] You can order more later, but it takes time — order plenty now

### Funeral / Memorial Planning
- [ ] Check the [Funeral Preferences section](the-checklist.md#funeral--memorial-preferences) for their wishes
- [ ] Check for [Religious & Cultural Requirements](the-checklist.md#religious--cultural-requirements) — some are time-sensitive
- [ ] Choose a funeral home (or use the one they specified)
- [ ] Decide: burial or cremation (check their documented preference)
- [ ] If a veteran, contact the VA — they provide burial benefits, a headstone, and a flag at no cost. Call 1-800-827-1000.
- [ ] Set a date for the service (usually 3-7 days out, but there's no rule)
- [ ] Ask someone to handle the obituary draft — see [Obituary Preferences](the-checklist.md#obituary-preferences) for their wishes on what to include/exclude
- [ ] **Do NOT publish the home address in the obituary** — burglars read obituaries to know when homes will be empty. Ask a neighbor or friend to stay at the house during the service.
- [ ] Designate someone to manage the guest logistics (food, flowers, venue)

### Government Notifications
- [ ] **Social Security Administration** — Call 1-800-772-1213. The funeral home often reports the death, but confirm it was done. If SSA benefits were being received, they must stop. Overpayments will be clawed back.
- [ ] If they were receiving **Medicare, Medicaid, VA benefits, SNAP, or disability** — these agencies need to be notified. See [Government Notifications](the-checklist.md#government-notifications) in the full checklist.

### Protect Against Identity Theft
- [ ] **Contact all three credit bureaus** to place a deceased alert on the credit file:
  - **Equifax:** 1-800-525-6285
  - **Experian:** 1-888-397-3742
  - **TransUnion:** 1-800-680-7289
- [ ] You will need: full legal name, SSN, date of birth, date of death, and a certified copy of the death certificate
- [ ] This prevents someone from opening credit cards or loans in the deceased person's name (this is more common than you think)
- [ ] See [Identity Theft Protection](the-checklist.md#identity-theft-protection) in the full checklist for complete steps

### Financial — First Steps Only
- [ ] **Do NOT close any bank accounts yet** — you may need them for bills
- [ ] **If you're on a joint account:** Be aware that some banks freeze accounts when notified of a death — even joint accounts. Make sure you have enough cash for immediate needs before notifying the bank. Talk to the attorney first.
- [ ] Identify which bills are on autopay and from which accounts (see [Financial section](the-checklist.md#financial))
- [ ] Make sure mortgage/rent gets paid this month
- [ ] Make sure utilities stay on
- [ ] Contact life insurance companies to start claims (they'll tell you what they need)
- [ ] If they were the primary earner, you may qualify for Social Security survivor benefits — don't rush this, but know it exists

### Digital — First Steps Only
- [ ] Access their phone if possible (see [Digital Life section](the-checklist.md#digital-life) for PIN/password info)
- [ ] Check their email for any time-sensitive items (bills, appointments, obligations)
- [ ] Check for **upcoming travel** — flights, hotels, Airbnbs, rental cars. These may be refundable if cancelled quickly. See [Pending Travel & Reservations](the-checklist.md#pending-travel--reservations).
- [ ] Do NOT delete any accounts yet — some may be needed for legal/financial processes
- [ ] If they have social media, consider posting a brief notice or having a friend do it
- [ ] Turn OFF any smart home automations that might be confusing (lights, routines, etc.)
- [ ] Consider setting up an **email auto-responder** on their account: *"[Name] has passed away. For urgent matters, please contact [executor name] at [phone/email]."*

### Physical Mail
- [ ] Collect mail daily from the mailbox
- [ ] If nobody will be at the home regularly, file a **USPS mail forwarding** request to the executor's address (usps.com or any post office)
- [ ] Watch for: bills, legal notices, tax documents, insurance correspondence, jury summons, vehicle registration renewals
- [ ] Mail will keep arriving for months (sometimes years). Expect junk mail, renewal notices, and the occasional gut-punch birthday card from a company database.

## Where Are the Medical Directives?

*Fill this section in so someone can find these documents within minutes, not days.*

| Document | Location | Who Has a Copy |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Healthcare Power of Attorney | `_______________` | `_______________` |
| Living Will / Advance Directive | `_______________` | `_______________` |
| DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) Order | `_______________` | `_______________` |
| POLST / MOLST Form | `_______________` | `_______________` |
| Organ Donation Preference | `_______________` | `_______________` |

---

## Where Is the Password Manager?

*Almost everything in [the full checklist](the-checklist.md) points back to a password manager. Here's how to get into it.*

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| Password Manager Used | `_______________` (e.g., 1Password, Bitwarden, LastPass) |
| How to Access It | `_______________` |
| Emergency Kit / Recovery Info Location | `_______________` |
| Who Else Has Access | `_______________` |

> **Note for families:** A "password manager" is an app or service that stores all of someone's passwords in one secure place. You only need ONE master password or recovery kit to access everything inside it. The location of that master password or recovery kit is the single most important piece of information in this entire document.

> **If you're locked out:** If the emergency kit is in a safe you can't open, or in a password manager you can't access — check with the attorney, the executor, or any trusted person listed in this document. There should be at least one access path that doesn't depend on another locked system. If not, a locksmith can open a physical safe, and most password managers have an account recovery process that requires identity verification and a waiting period.

## The Short Version

If you're overwhelmed and can only do five things today:

1. **Notify the inner circle** (the emergency contacts above)
2. **Secure the home, the pets, and the kids**
3. **Find the will** (check the location listed in this document)
4. **Don't close or cancel anything yet** — just make sure this month's bills get paid
5. **Take care of yourself** — eat something, drink water, sleep when you can

Everything else can wait. You have more time than you think.

## After the First 72 Hours: The 30/60/90 Day Follow-Up

*The crisis has passed but the work hasn't. Here's what needs to happen over the next three months. Nobody tells families this part — they think it's done after the funeral. It's not.*

### By Day 30

- [ ] **Follow up on life insurance claims** — if you haven't heard back, call again. Claims can take 30-60 days.
- [ ] **File for Social Security survivor benefits** (if applicable) — visit ssa.gov or call 1-800-772-1213. Surviving spouses and minor children may be eligible.
- [ ] **Notify all financial institutions** — banks, brokerages, credit card companies. Bring a certified death certificate to each.
- [ ] **Contact the CPA/tax preparer** — a final tax return will need to be filed for the year of death. If the estate is large enough, an estate tax return (Form 706) may be required. The CPA needs to know now, not in April.
- [ ] **Cancel or transfer utilities** if the home is being vacated
- [ ] **Return rented or leased medical equipment** — hospital beds, oxygen concentrators, wheelchairs. The supplier will keep billing the estate.
- [ ] **Cancel ongoing commitments** — see [Ongoing Commitments](the-checklist.md#ongoing-commitments--obligations) in the full checklist
- [ ] **Review autopay subscriptions** — cancel everything that's not needed. Check credit card and bank statements for the last 12 months.
- [ ] **Notify the DMV** to cancel the driver's license (prevents identity theft)
- [ ] **Forward or monitor mail** — watch for anything you missed

### By Day 60

- [ ] **Check probate status** — if the estate is going through probate, check in with the attorney on timeline and next steps
- [ ] **Confirm credit bureau alerts are active** — check all three bureaus
- [ ] **Begin the process of retitling assets** — vehicles, real estate, investment accounts that need to be transferred to beneficiaries
- [ ] **Review all insurance policies** — are there policies you missed? Check old mail, email, and the full checklist.
- [ ] **File any pending insurance claims** (auto, home, etc. if applicable)
- [ ] **Close unnecessary bank accounts** — once all autopay has been moved and final bills are settled
- [ ] **Handle digital accounts** — memorialize, delete, or close accounts per their wishes (see [Digital Life](the-checklist.md#digital-life))

### By Day 90

- [ ] **Subscription audit** — go through every credit card and bank statement for a full 12 months. Annual subscriptions hide. Find them.
- [ ] **Address outstanding debts** — work with the attorney on what the estate owes vs. what the family does not owe. Remember: creditors will try to collect from family members. In most cases, they cannot.
- [ ] **Update your own estate documents** — this experience likely revealed gaps in your own planning. Update your own will, POA, and beneficiary designations.
- [ ] **Request a credit report** for the deceased from annualcreditreport.com — check for any fraudulent accounts opened since the death
- [ ] **Take stock** — is everything settled? What's still outstanding? Make a list and work through it with the attorney.

## Grief & Support Resources

*This document is mechanical by design — checklists, tables, tasks. But the person reading it is a human being going through one of the hardest experiences of their life. Here are real resources.*

### Crisis Support
- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:** Call or text **988** (24/7)
- **Crisis Text Line:** Text **HOME** to **741741** (24/7)

### Grief Support
- **GriefShare:** griefshare.org — Free support groups in communities nationwide. In-person and online.
- **The Dinner Party:** thedinnerparty.org — Peer support for people in their 20s-40s who've experienced loss.
- **AARP Grief & Loss:** aarp.org/caregiving/grief — Resources for older adults and their families.
- **National Alliance for Grieving Children:** childrengrieve.org — Resources specifically for grieving kids.
- **Local hospice organizations** often provide free bereavement counseling for up to a year, even if the person was not a hospice patient. Call your local hospice and ask.

### Practical Support
- **FEMA Funeral Assistance:** fema.gov — If the death was related to a federally declared disaster, FEMA may reimburse funeral costs up to a set limit.
- **State Bar Association:** Most state bar associations offer a lawyer referral service for estate and probate matters, often with a reduced-fee initial consultation.
- **Benefits.gov:** benefits.gov — Check for government benefits the surviving family may be eligible for (Social Security, Medicaid, SNAP, housing assistance, veteran benefits).

### For Children
- Kids grieve differently than adults. They may seem fine for weeks and then fall apart at an unrelated moment. This is normal.
- Don't lie to them. Use real words: "died" not "passed away" or "went to sleep." Kids take things literally.
- Maintain their routine as much as possible. School, activities, bedtime — structure is safety for a kid whose world just shattered.
- Consider grief counseling. Many schools have counselors who can help. Ask.
