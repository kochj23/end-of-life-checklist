# Contributing

This is an open source template. It gets better when people share what they wish they'd known.

## How to Contribute

### Suggesting New Sections or Questions
If you went through a family emergency and realized something critical was missing from this template, open an issue describing:
- What information was needed
- Why it mattered
- Where in the document it should go

### Improving Clarity
If any section is confusing — especially for non-technical readers — submit a PR or open an issue. The person reading this document will be grieving and overwhelmed. Clarity saves them time and stress.

### Localization
If you want to adapt this for a specific country's legal or financial systems (estate law varies significantly by country), consider creating a localized version in a subdirectory (e.g., `locales/uk/`, `locales/canada/`).

### What Not to Contribute
- Do not add sections that require legal expertise to fill in correctly. This is a practical guide, not a legal document.
- Do not add product recommendations or affiliate links.
- Do not submit personal information, even as an "example." Use clearly fake placeholder data.

## Code of Conduct

Be kind. The subject matter is heavy. People contributing to this project are often doing so because they've been through something difficult. Treat them accordingly.
