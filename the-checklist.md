## Debts & Obligations

## Digital Life

**Phone Carrier:** `_______________`

> **Important:** If the phone uses biometric unlock (Face ID, fingerprint), it may still work shortly after death. Some families use this to access the phone before it locks permanently. This is time-sensitive.

### Email Accounts

|----------|-------------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| `_______________` | `_______________` | [ ] Personal [ ] Work [ ] Other | `_______________` | `_______________` |

> **Apple:** Has a [Legacy Contact](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212360) feature. Set this up.

### Social Media

*Document what you want done with each account — memorialize, delete, or leave alone.*

| Platform | Username/Profile | What To Do With It | Notes |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| Facebook | `_______________` | [ ] Memorialize [ ] Delete [ ] Leave | Legacy Contact: `_______________` |

**Photo Library Primary Location:** `_______________`
**Photo Backups:** `_______________`

> **Note:** Family photos may be one of the most valuable things in your digital life. Make sure someone knows where they are and can access them.

### Subscriptions & Recurring Payments

*These will keep charging after you're gone. Someone needs to cancel them.*

| Service | Monthly/Annual Cost | Payment Method | Category | Cancel? |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|----------|---------|
| `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` | Streaming | [ ] |
| `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` | Streaming | [ ] |
| `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` | Music | [ ] |
| `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` | Software | [ ] |
| `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` | Cloud Storage | [ ] |

| `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` | Other | [ ] |

> **Pro tip:** Check credit card and bank statements for the last 12 months to find subscriptions you forgot about. Annual subscriptions are easy to miss.

### Cryptocurrency & Digital Assets

| Platform/Wallet | Type | How to Access | Recovery Seed Location | Approximate Value |
|----------------|------|-------------|----------------------|------------------|
| `_______________` | [ ] Exchange [ ] Hardware Wallet [ ] Software Wallet | `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` |
| `_______________` | [ ] Exchange [ ] Hardware Wallet [ ] Software Wallet | `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` |

> **Critical:** Cryptocurrency that can't be accessed is cryptocurrency that's gone forever. If you hold crypto, the recovery seed phrase is literally worth the value of the holdings. Store it securely (fireproof safe, bank safe deposit box) and make sure your executor knows it exists.

### Domains, Websites & Hosting

| Domain/Site | Registrar | Hosting Provider | Auto-Renew? | What To Do |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|------------|-----------|
