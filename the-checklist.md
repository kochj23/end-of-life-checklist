## Tax Obligations

*The IRS does not pause for grief. Someone has to handle this — usually the executor, with help from the CPA.*

### What Needs to Be Filed

| Return | Who Files It | Deadline | Notes |
|--------|-------------|----------|-------|
| **Final individual tax return** (Form 1040) | Executor or surviving spouse | April 15 of the year after death | Covers Jan 1 through date of death. If married, surviving spouse can file jointly for the year of death. |
| **Estate income tax return** (Form 1041) | Executor | April 15 of the year after the estate's tax year ends | Only if the estate earns income (interest, dividends, rent) after the date of death. |
| **Estate tax return** (Form 706) | Executor | 9 months after date of death | Only required if the estate exceeds the federal exemption (currently ~$13M per person). Most estates don't need this, but check with the CPA. |
| **State tax returns** | Executor | Varies by state | Some states have their own estate/inheritance tax with lower thresholds than federal. |

### Tax-Related Information

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| CPA / Tax Preparer | `_______________` |
| CPA Phone | `_______________` |
| Tax Returns Location (last 7 years) | `_______________` |

| Estimated Tax Payments Made This Year? | [ ] Yes [ ] No — Amount: `_______________` |

> **Note for families:** Contact the CPA as soon as possible — ideally within the first 30 days. They need to know the date of death, and they may need access to financial records to prepare the final returns. Don't ignore this because you're overwhelmed. The CPA does the work — you just need to authorize them.

## Insurance

### Life Insurance

| Policy | Company | Policy # Location | Type | Benefit Amount | Beneficiary | Agent/Phone |
|--------|---------|------------------|------|---------------|-------------|-------------|

| `___` | `_______________` | `_______________` | [ ] Term [ ] Whole [ ] Universal | `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` |

> **Don't forget:** Many employers provide a basic life insurance policy (often 1-2x salary). Check with HR. Some credit cards, mortgages, and unions also include accidental death coverage.

|------|---------|------------------|-------------|-------|
| Health Insurance | `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` |

## Property & Physical Assets

### Real Estate

| Property | Address | Owned/Rented | Mortgage Company | Property Tax Authority | HOA? |
|----------|---------|-------------|-----------------|----------------------|------|
| Primary Residence | `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` |
| `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` |

**Property Tax Status:**
- [ ] Current and up to date
- [ ] Paid through: `_______________`
- [ ] Auto-drafted from: `_______________` *(escrowed? paid separately?)*
- [ ] Tax assessor contact: `_______________`

**Mortgage Details:**

| Item | Details |

| Mortgage Company | `_______________` |
| Approximate Balance | `_______________` |
| Monthly Payment | `_______________` |
| Payment Method | `_______________` *(autopay? from which account?)* |
| Mortgage Life Insurance? | [ ] Yes [ ] No |

**Deed Location:** `_______________`
**Title Insurance Policy Location:** `_______________`

### Rental Properties (If You Are a Landlord)

*If you own rental properties, your tenants need to know who to contact. Leases survive your death — tenants cannot be evicted just because the landlord died. Someone needs to manage these properties or the estate will lose income and the tenants will be left in limbo.*

| Property Address | Tenant(s) | Lease Expiration | Monthly Rent | Property Manager | Notes |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` |
| `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` |

**Property Management Company (if any):** `_______________`
**Phone:** `_______________`

**If there's no property manager:** Someone needs to step in to collect rent, handle maintenance requests, and communicate with tenants. Name a person: `_______________`

### Storage Units

| Facility | Address | Unit # | Monthly Cost | Paid How | What's In It |
|----------|---------|--------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` |

### Warranties & Service Contracts

*Some are transferable to new owners. Some pay out on failure. Most will expire, but a few are worth knowing about.*

| Item | Provider | Expires | Transferable? | Contract Location |
|------|---------|---------|--------------|------------------|
| Home Warranty | `_______________` | `_______________` | [ ] Yes [ ] No | `_______________` |
| `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` | [ ] Yes [ ] No | `_______________` |
| `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` | [ ] Yes [ ] No | `_______________` |

---

## Debts & Obligations

*Your family needs to know what you owe. They also need to know that in most cases, your debts are NOT their debts — creditors will try to convince them otherwise. The estate pays debts, not the family (with exceptions for co-signers and community property states).*

### Outstanding Debts

| Creditor | Type | Approximate Balance | Monthly Payment | Co-signed? | Autopay? |
|----------|------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|----------|
| `_______________` | [ ] Mortgage [ ] HELOC | `_______________` | `_______________` | [ ] Yes [ ] No | [ ] Yes [ ] No |
| `_______________` | [ ] Auto Loan | `_______________` | `_______________` | [ ] Yes [ ] No | [ ] Yes [ ] No |
| `_______________` | [ ] Student Loan | `_______________` | `_______________` | [ ] Yes [ ] No | [ ] Yes [ ] No |
| `_______________` | [ ] Personal Loan | `_______________` | `_______________` | [ ] Yes [ ] No | [ ] Yes [ ] No |
| `_______________` | [ ] Medical Debt | `_______________` | `_______________` | [ ] Yes [ ] No | [ ] Yes [ ] No |
| `_______________` | [ ] Credit Card | `_______________` | `_______________` | [ ] Yes [ ] No | [ ] Yes [ ] No |
| `_______________` | [ ] Other | `_______________` | `_______________` | [ ] Yes [ ] No | [ ] Yes [ ] No |

> **For the family:** Debt collectors will call. They may pressure you to pay from your own money. In most states, you are NOT personally responsible for the deceased person's debts unless you co-signed or are a spouse in a community property state. Consult the attorney before paying anything. The estate is responsible — not you.

### Money Owed TO You

| Who Owes You | Approximate Amount | Documentation | Notes |

## Digital Life

### The Master Key: Password Manager

> **For the family:** The password manager is the skeleton key. Once you're into it, you can access almost everything else. If there's an "Emergency Kit" (a PDF or printed document), it has everything you need to get in. Find that first.

|--------|------|----------------------|-------|

**Phone Carrier:** `_______________`
**Account PIN/Password Location:** `_______________`

> **Important:** If the phone uses biometric unlock (Face ID, fingerprint), it may still work shortly after death. Some families use this to access the phone before it locks permanently. This is time-sensitive.

### Email Accounts

| Provider | Email Address | Primary Use | Recovery Email | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| `_______________` | `_______________` | [ ] Personal [ ] Work [ ] Other | `_______________` | `_______________` |
| `_______________` | `_______________` | [ ] Personal [ ] Work [ ] Other | `_______________` | `_______________` |

> **Google:** Has an [Inactive Account Manager](https://myaccount.google.com/inactive) that can grant access to trusted contacts. Set this up.
> **Apple:** Has a [Legacy Contact](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212360) feature. Set this up.

### Social Media

*Document what you want done with each account — memorialize, delete, or leave alone.*

| Platform | Username/Profile | What To Do With It | Notes |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| Facebook | `_______________` | [ ] Memorialize [ ] Delete [ ] Leave | Legacy Contact: `_______________` |

### Cloud Storage & Photos

|---------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| iCloud | `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` |
| Google Drive | `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` |
| Dropbox | `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` |
| OneDrive | `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` |
| `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` |

**Photo Library Primary Location:** `_______________`
**Photo Backups:** `_______________`

> **Note:** Family photos may be one of the most valuable things in your digital life. Make sure someone knows where they are and can access them.

### Subscriptions & Recurring Payments

*These will keep charging after you're gone. Someone needs to cancel them.*

| Service | Monthly/Annual Cost | Payment Method | Category | Cancel? |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|----------|---------|
| `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` | Streaming | [ ] |
| `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` | Streaming | [ ] |
| `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` | Music | [ ] |

| `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` | Membership / Club | [ ] |
| `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` | Charity / Donation | [ ] |
| `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` | Other | [ ] |

> **Pro tip:** Check credit card and bank statements for the last 12 months to find subscriptions you forgot about. Annual subscriptions are easy to miss.

### Cryptocurrency & Digital Assets

| Platform/Wallet | Type | How to Access | Recovery Seed Location | Approximate Value |
|----------------|------|-------------|----------------------|------------------|
| `_______________` | [ ] Exchange [ ] Hardware Wallet [ ] Software Wallet | `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` |
| `_______________` | [ ] Exchange [ ] Hardware Wallet [ ] Software Wallet | `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` |

> **Critical:** Cryptocurrency that can't be accessed is cryptocurrency that's gone forever. If you hold crypto, the recovery seed phrase is literally worth the value of the holdings. Store it securely (fireproof safe, bank safe deposit box) and make sure your executor knows it exists.

### Domains, Websites & Hosting

| Domain/Site | Registrar | Hosting Provider | Auto-Renew? | What To Do |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|------------|-----------|
| `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` | [ ] Yes [ ] No | `_______________` |

| Steam | `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` |
| PlayStation | `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` |

## Government Notifications

*These agencies need to be notified of the death. Some stop benefits, some start benefits, some just need the record updated. The funeral home typically notifies Social Security, but don't assume — confirm.*

- [ ] **Presidential Memorial Certificate** — signed by the sitting president

## Identity Theft Protection

*Dead people are prime targets for identity theft. Criminals scan obituaries and public death records, then apply for credit cards, loans, and tax refunds in the deceased person's name. This is not theoretical — it is extremely common. Protect the estate.*

### Immediate Steps (Within First Week)

- [ ] **Equifax** — Call 1-800-525-6285 to report the death and request a deceased alert
- [ ] **Experian** — Call 1-888-397-3742 to report the death and request a deceased alert
- [ ] **TransUnion** — Call 1-800-680-7289 to report the death and request a deceased alert
- [ ] You will need: full legal name, Social Security number, date of birth, date of death, and a certified copy of the death certificate for each bureau

### Additional Steps (Within 30 Days)

- [ ] **Request a credit report** from annualcreditreport.com — check for any accounts you don't recognize
- [ ] **Notify the DMV** to cancel the driver's license
- [ ] **Opt out of prescreened credit offers** — call 1-888-567-8688 or visit optoutprescreen.com (reduces junk mail that could be intercepted)
- [ ] **Monitor the mail** for unexpected credit card offers, account statements, or collection notices — these may indicate fraud

### At 90 Days

- [ ] **Pull another credit report** from all three bureaus — check for any new fraudulent accounts opened since the death
- [ ] Report any fraud to the FTC at identitytheft.gov and file a police report if necessary

## Household Operations

*The day-to-day things that keep a house running. If you're gone, someone needs to know where the shutoff valves are.*

### Physical Mail

## Funeral & Memorial Preferences

*Your family will agonize over every detail if you don't write this down. Save them the guilt of guessing.*

### Religious & Cultural Requirements

*Some faiths and cultures have very specific requirements about timing, body preparation, burial orientation, and ritual. If these matter to you, they need to be documented clearly because the people making arrangements may not know the details — and some requirements are measured in hours, not days.*

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| Faith / Cultural Tradition | `_______________` |
| Specific requirements for body preparation | `_______________` *(ritual washing, shroud, specific clothing, etc.)* |
| Time-sensitive requirements | `_______________` *(e.g., burial within 24 hours)* |
| Burial orientation / positioning | `_______________` *(e.g., facing Mecca)* |
| Restrictions | `_______________` *(e.g., no embalming, no cremation, no autopsy)* |
| Religious leader to contact | `_______________` |
| Phone | `_______________` |
| Congregation / Mosque / Temple / Church | `_______________` |
| Specific prayers, rituals, or readings required | `_______________` |

> **For the family:** If you're not sure about the person's religious or cultural requirements, contact their religious leader or community IMMEDIATELY. Some traditions have very strict timelines. Getting it wrong is much harder to fix after the fact.

*Beyond the emergency contacts. These are people who should know, but don't need to be called at 3 AM.*

## Personal Wishes & Bequests

*Things you want specific people to have. The will handles the legal distribution — this is for the personal stuff that doesn't make it into legal documents.*

## Letters to Loved Ones

*A section in a checklist is not the right place for your last words to the people you love. But this is the right place to tell someone those letters exist.*

*If you have things to say to specific people — your kids, your partner, your parents, a friend — write them. Seal them. Put their name on the envelope. Store them somewhere they'll be found.*

| Envelope For | Stored At | Notes |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` |
| `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` |
| `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` |
| `_______________` | `_______________` | `_______________` |

**All letters are stored at:** `_______________` *(e.g., "fireproof safe, top shelf," "with attorney," etc.)*

> **If you haven't written these yet:** You don't have to write a novel. A single page, in your own handwriting, telling someone what they meant to you — that piece of paper will be the most valuable thing you've ever written. Do it today. You can always revise it later. You might not get a later.

---

## The Uncomfortable Stuff

*This section exists because you're a human being with a private life. You'd rather handle this yourself, but you can't. So you're trusting someone to handle it for you. Pick that person carefully.*

**Person I trust to handle this section:** `_______________`
**Their phone:** `_______________`
**Relationship:** `_______________`

### Things to Delete / Destroy Without Looking

*Be specific. "My laptop" is not specific enough.*

## Grief & Support Resources

*This document is mechanical by design — checklists, tables, tasks. But you're a person, not an executor. Here are real resources for the human part.*

### Crisis Support
- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:** Call or text **988** (24/7)
- **Crisis Text Line:** Text **HOME** to **741741** (24/7)

### Grief Support
- **GriefShare:** griefshare.org — Free support groups nationwide, in-person and online
- **The Dinner Party:** thedinnerparty.org — Peer support for people in their 20s-40s
- **National Alliance for Grieving Children:** childrengrieve.org
- **Local hospice organizations** often provide free bereavement counseling for up to a year, even if the person was not a hospice patient

### For Children
- Use real words: "died" not "passed away" or "went to sleep"
- Maintain their routine as much as possible
- They may seem fine for weeks and then fall apart — this is normal
- Ask the school counselor for support
