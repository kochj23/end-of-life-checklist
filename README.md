# End of Life Checklist

**The document nobody wants to write, but everyone's family needs.**

---

## What Is This?

This is a comprehensive template for documenting everything your family, partner, or trusted person would need to know if you were suddenly incapacitated or died. Not the fun stuff. The real stuff.

This isn't a will. This isn't a legal document. This is the practical, unglamorous, sometimes uncomfortable guide that answers the question:

> *"You're gone. Your family just walked into your house. Now what?"*

Where are the bank accounts? Who's the mortgage with? What's the WiFi password? Is there a DNR? Who gets the dog? Where's the will? Are the property taxes paid? What do they do with your browser history?

All of it.

## Why Does This Exist?

Because families fall apart trying to figure this stuff out during the worst week of their lives. Because "I'll get to it eventually" turns into "nobody knows the password to Dad's email." Because the people who love you shouldn't have to play detective while they're grieving.

This template was born from real family emergencies. It exists so you can fill it out now, while you're thinking clearly, so the people you leave behind don't have to guess.

## How to Use This

### Option 1: Fork and Fill In (Recommended)

1. **Fork this repository** to your own GitHub account
2. **Make your fork PRIVATE** immediately (Settings > Danger Zone > Change visibility)
3. Fill in the template with your actual information
4. Tell at least **two trusted people** that this document exists and where to find it
5. Review and update it at least once a year

### Option 2: Download and Store Locally

1. Download `the-checklist.md` and `first-72-hours.md`
2. Fill them in with any text editor
3. Store copies in:
   - A USB drive in a fireproof safe
   - A trusted cloud service (encrypted)
   - With your attorney
   - With your executor

### Option 3: Print It

Some families aren't technical. Print the filled-in version, put it in a binder, and store it somewhere your family knows about. A physical copy in a fireproof safe or with your attorney is never a bad idea.

## The Files

| File | What It Is |
|------|-----------|
| [`first-72-hours.md`](first-72-hours.md) | **Read this first.** A step-by-step emergency guide for the first 3 days. No fluff. Just what to do and in what order. |
| [`the-checklist.md`](the-checklist.md) | The full document. Every account, every policy, every preference, every uncomfortable detail. |

## Important Security Notes

**This template is designed so you NEVER put actual passwords, account numbers, or sensitive credentials directly in this document.**

Instead, you document:
- **Where** credentials are stored (e.g., "1Password," "fireproof safe in office closet")
- **How** to access the password manager (e.g., "Emergency Kit is in the safe deposit box at First National Bank")
- **Who** has access or authorization (e.g., "Attorney Jane Smith has a sealed copy")

The goal is a **map**, not a treasure chest. Point people to the right doors — don't leave the keys lying around.

If you're using a password manager (you should be), most of them have an "Emergency Access" or "Emergency Kit" feature. Set that up. Document that it exists in this checklist.

## How Often Should You Update This?

- **Annually** at minimum (pick a date — your birthday, New Year's, tax day)
- **After any major life event:** marriage, divorce, new child, home purchase, job change, new account, new pet, diagnosis
- **After any change to legal documents:** new will, updated power of attorney, new insurance policy

## Sharing This Document

Tell at least **two people** this document exists. They don't need access right now — they need to know it exists and where to find it when the time comes.

Good candidates:
- Spouse or partner
- Adult children
- Sibling
- Attorney
- Executor of your estate
- A trusted friend who is organized and level-headed under pressure

Consider leaving a sealed letter in your fireproof safe or with your attorney that says: *"If something happens to me, there is a document at [location] that has everything you need."*

## A Note About the Uncomfortable Parts

This template includes a section called "The Uncomfortable Stuff." It's there on purpose.

Everyone has things they'd rather deal with themselves — private journals, accounts they'd rather not explain, personal items, digital footprints. The point isn't to air your laundry. The point is to make sure someone you trust handles it the way you'd want, instead of your entire family stumbling across it during the worst week of their lives.

You're an adult. Fill it in like one. Your executor will thank you.

## Contributing

This is an open source template. If you think a section is missing, a question isn't asked, or something could be clearer, open an issue or submit a pull request. This document gets better when people share what they wish they'd known.

## License

MIT License. Use it, fork it, share it, adapt it. If it helps even one family avoid the chaos of figuring this out from scratch, it was worth publishing.
